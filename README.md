# Hello and thank you for visiting my page!  I am trying to learn how to do basic programming in hopes of gaining acceptance into a software engineer school that will help train me for an ever changing digital work space.  Please provide any feedback.  The best way to reach me would be on Twitter @MeatFarmer.  Thanks!  Joey
